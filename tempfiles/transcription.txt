 Let's start with plug data to streamline your data into data pipelines. So this is a long lorine page.  eTL tool where we just fetch data from source location and dump that data  to the  to create your connections and add different connections from multiple sources  U.S.  •  where we can create data sets from the existing connections.   to the connections and from that we are automating automatically getting the list of tables that we have.  So we can directly create a data set and we can visualize that what kind of data we have in that particular table. So we created a temporary table  to understand. We already have a data set with the same configurations. So no need to create again ()  the data set we have  U  to create pipeline as a  .  and  and then we need to select the destination dataset after selecting the destination dataset we need to click on create pipeline so our  UH   UH  data  the  the  Now we can see that this is our pipeline test 1, 2, 3 it is visible now and like we can turn on that pipeline and now it is visible on the active section  in the best parties or platform plug data is that we are using airflow architecture.  When we create a new data pipeline and an ETL pipeline we need to write code for each and everything for each functionality  the  Thank you.
